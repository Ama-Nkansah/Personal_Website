          I build smart, functional products out of raw ideas whether you‚Äôre a founder with a plan or just figuring it out. 
          Behind the code, I‚Äôm all about systems thinking, clean architecture, and building things that can actually grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          My journey into tech started in Level 100, exploring data analysis, but something felt missing. I wasn‚Äôt fulfilled. 
          I needed more ‚Äî more creativity, more problem-solving, more impact. That ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment came in Level 200, when I transitioned fully into software engineering.
          Since then, I‚Äôve been obsessed with turning ideas into code that solves real problems and scales with purpose.

          I like to keep things simple, fast, and effective. I believe in testing ideas early, building smart MVPs, and improving as we go. Every project I touch is built with clarity, structure, and growth in mind.
          I work full-stack using tools like React, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, and databases. I also integrate AI and cloud tools to make things even smarter.
          <br />
          <br/>
          But beyond the code, I‚Äôm a tech content creator, public speaker, and mentor. I love sharing what I know, helping beginners grow, and making tech feel less scary, simple and more exciting.
          At the heart of it all, my goal is simple:
          Build great systems and help more people feel like they belong in tech.
