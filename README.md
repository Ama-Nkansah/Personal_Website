## Customization

### Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Apply utility classes directly in your components for fast, responsive design.

**Example:**

```jsx
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-blue-600">
  Welcome to My Website
</h1>
```

### Aliases

Simplify import paths using the `@` alias in `vite.config.js`.

**Example:**

```jsx
import Header from '@/components/Header';
```

## Useful Commands

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.
